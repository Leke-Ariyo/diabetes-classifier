# Diabetes Dataset Task

## Introduction

This repository contains a dataset related to diabetes and a task associated with it. The dataset consists of various features related to diabetes patients, and the task involves performing analysis or predictive modeling based on the provided data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

1. **Age**: The age of the patient.
2. **Sex**: The gender of the patient (Male/Female).
3. **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a numerical value representing the patient's body composition.
4. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's blood pressure measurement.
5. **Glucose**: The patient's glucose level.
6. **Insulin**: The amount of insulin the patient has been administered.
7. **Skin Thickness**: The thickness of the patient's skin.
8. **Pregnancies**: The number of times the patient has been pregnant.
9. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A measure of the patient's susceptibility to diabetes based on family history.
10. **Outcome**: The target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not (0: No, 1: Yes).

## Task Description

The task associated with this dataset is to analyze and/or build a predictive model to identify patterns or predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on the provided features.

Possible tasks can include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying relationships between variables.
- Classification: Building a predictive model to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the given features.
- Feature Selection/Engineering: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting diabetes and creating new features if needed.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of different models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
